    1-Trend (T)
    2-Seasonility (S)
    3-Residual (R)

Once we need to get a statinory dataset before performing Time Series Analysis (TSA) flawlessly beacuse it would be easy making a predicition over a stationary dataset since it would already satisfy the preoperties of Normal Distribution in terms of mean and variance, roughly. So, we need to delve into the raw dataset
